# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to build a logistic regression model that classifies/diagnosis as tumors as malignant or benign.

# Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - UCI Breast Cancer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- Features: Mean radius, area, smoothness, and more
- Target: Diagnosis (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0)

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

##  ML Process
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Train-test split and model training
- Accuracy evaluation and classification report
-Built and tested fully on Kaggle — ideal for beginner-level ML deployment.
##  Result
“Achieved ~98% test data  accuracy on UCI Breast Cancer Dataset using logistic regression.”
